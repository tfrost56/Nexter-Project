# Nexter-Project
Nexter-Project is a real estate website constucted through CSS Grid and Sass for Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Advanced CSS and Sass.
This was my first experience using CSS grids in conjunction with flexbox.This project improved my CSS knowledge greatly
through a variety of animations, layouts, responsive imagery.
